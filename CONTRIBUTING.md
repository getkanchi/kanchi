# Contributing to Kanchi

Thanks for your interest in helping Kanchi grow.  
The goal of this project is to stay lightweight, practical, and enjoyable to work with.  
These guidelines help keep contributions smooth for everyone.

## Bug Fixes
If you found a bug and already know how to fix it,  
feel free to open a PR right away.

If you're unsure about the root cause or want to double-check the approach,  
please open an issue first so we can investigate together.

## Small Changes
Documentation tweaks, small refactors, or minor improvements are always welcome.  
No need to open an issue beforehand. Just open a PR.

## New Features or Larger Changes
For anything that introduces new functionality or changes how core parts behave,  
please start with an issue.

This gives us a chance to discuss:
- whether it fits the project's direction  
- how it should behave  
- any edge cases we should keep in mind

Once we're aligned, go ahead and open a PR.

## Picking Up Work
Issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted` are open for contribution.  
If you want to work on something, leave a short comment to avoid duplicates.

## Workflow
1. Fork the repo  
2. Create a feature branch  
3. Open a PR against `main`  
4. We'll review it together and merge when it's ready

Thanks again for contributing. Your help makes Kanchi better for everyone.
